The justifications are one of the most important parts of this work, so please take the time to write good ones! They are reviewed regularly and provide an indication of how much effort is getting put into tasks.

When writing a justification, we need to understand why you decided that one response could be considered the best one. There are 4 important dimensions that should be clear in your justification:

# Elements of a good justification
- **User Intent**: the justification should begin with a comment that demonstrates understanding of what the user is looking for with the prompt
- **Conclusion**: we need to determine which response is better and why. The comment should clearly explain the reasoning behind this decision
	- "Response A is better than response B..."
- **Supporting Claims**: the justification needs to have key supporting points to defend its conclusion.
	- "...because response B is correctly following the instructions..."
	- "...because response A facts can not be verified..."
- **Specific Evidence**: the precise examples or evidence in the text used to support each supporting point.
	- "...Response B goes off topic after the second paragraph..."
	- "...As stated in wikipedia.com/.../ this statement is incorrect..."
- **Analysis**: The explanation(s) of how the evidence defends the supporting claim
	- Summarize how your evidence supports your preference
