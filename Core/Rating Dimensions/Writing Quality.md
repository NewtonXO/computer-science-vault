Writing Quality in AI communication is a critical aspect that influences clarity, comprehension, and egagement. We'll explore 3 key elements:

1. Readability
2. Language Mechanics
3. Outilne & Coherence

# 1. Understanding Readability

## What is Readability?

Readability is the extent to which the response is free from grammatical or spelling errors that:
- would obscure a reader's ability to undrstand the content; or
- create an impression of unreliability in the response.

## How to evaluate

- After carefully reading the resonse, if you aren't easily able to spot a problem with spelling or grammar than you can consider the response as "No Issues"
- If there are multiple glaring errors in spelling or grammar select the grading "Major Issues"

# 2. Understanding Language Mechanics

## What are Language Mechanics?

Language mechanics refer to the correct and effective use of language elements like word choice, sentence structure, and punctuation.

## How to evaluate

Ask yourself if any of the ideas were noticeably difficult to follow for lack of effective mechanics.

# 3. Understanding Outline & Coherence

## What is Outline & Coherence?

Outline and coherence determine if the different ideas flow from one to another.

## How to evaluate

Assess whether the order of the ideas made sense in relation to the goals of the response, and how smoothly they transitioned from one to another with clear connections.
